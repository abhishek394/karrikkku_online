							The database we are designed is came from one of the contest of our day to day life, were
most of us are felt restless to get a coconut climber especially in current times.This problem led us
to find an easy way to combine all the coconut climbers under one roof which will provide
information regarding coconut climbers.There no such database is known to exist currently so it is
a new concept altogether.The database provide and redefine the way we look on unorganized
workers who works for daily wages to a higher status and provide better platform to excel.

								The problem of scarcity and availability of coconut tree climbers are monitored and managed by using
database software platform which allows the user to access the database created by our group known as
karikk online.The coconut farmers and people who has coconut trees in their homes can use this database the users who
need coconut trees can also use the features available in the database The database can be used by providing
user id and details in the login, the coconut tree climbers can upload their information according to needs of
users.							</p>

							<p>
								The amazing part about having a karikku Database is that it is a
								storage bin that holds onto all saved data of coconut climbers. Well if only
								one user had access to that data its just like what we have
								built into our own computers, it wouldn't be useful to
								others users. However, the joy of having a coconut database is that
								it is a storage bin many farmers can interact with, creating,
								reading, updating and deleting information that all users
								would see.
